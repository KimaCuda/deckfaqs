## DeckFAQs, a GameFAQs browser for the Steam Deck (v1.5.1)

-   Fixes most issues with DeckFAQs and Steam Client Beta
    - Fixes issues where Modals no longer worked and would effectively require a restart of the Steam Client
    - Fixes issue with navigating back to the DeckFAQs QAM when in full screen guides
-   **Note**: There is an issue in the Steam Client Beta where on the quick access menu you use the search/TOC feature, the QAM seesm to lose focus when you come back and the guide scroll with the joystick won't work. You can workaround this by tapping the guide so the focus ring shows up then click A and you should be able to scroll. This issue does not seem occur when viewing a guide when in fullscreen. If it's not fixed by the final release of the next Steam Client, I will see if I can fix it but for now I'm just waiting
