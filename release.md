### DeckFAQs, a GameFAQs browser for the Steam Deck (v1.2.1)

-   **BUGFIX** Fix an issue where guides in the list can get duplicated
-   Loading indicator added when data is loading
-   Renders guide directly in side panel instead of through iframes
-   Scrolling to anchor points in HTML guides added
-   Adds Table of Contents for HTML based guides
-   Better fullscreen guide support
-   Dark Mode preference (preference remembered across sessions of using DeckFAQs)
-   Possibly some other stuff I forgot because I spent too long working on this
-   _NOTE:_ This version (and any version >= 1.0.0) is not compatible with the original PluginLoader. You must use the "Decky Loader" which is the react based plugin loader
