## DeckFAQs, a GameFAQs browser for the Steam Deck (v1.3)

### The scroll and search update!

-   Adds the ability to search plain-text guides in the quick access menu. Search is supported for all guides in fullscreen view. Search is case insensitive.
-   Adds scrolling of guides with the gamepad. Scrolling works with either the joystick or dpad. Guide must have focus (click the guide with the A button). Focus can be removed by pressing B.
-   _NOTE:_ This version (and any version >= 1.0.0) is not compatible with the original PluginLoader. You must use the "Decky Loader" which is the react based plugin loader
