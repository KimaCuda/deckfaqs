### DeckFAQs, a GameFAQs browser for the Steam Deck (v0.1.0)
* Supports both Steam and non-Steam games
* Supports both rich-text and plain-text guides
* Built using React and TypeScript and the Steam Deck Plugin Loader

### How it Works
* Finds all steam games and non-steam games and display them as a list
* Clicking on a game search GameFAQs for potential options
* Selecting an option displays all guides for the selected game (recommended guides show up at the top of the list)
* Selecting a guide will either display the guide in an iframe (if an rich-text guide) or as plain-text (if a old school plain-text guide)
