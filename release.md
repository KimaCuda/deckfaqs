### DeckFAQs, a GameFAQs browser for the Steam Deck (v1.1.0)

- Renders guide directly in side panel instead of through iframes
- Scrolling to anchor points in HTML guides added
- Adds Table of Contents for HTML based guides
- Better fullscreen guide support
- Possibly some other stuff I forgot because I spent too long working on this
- *NOTE:* This version (and any version >= 1.0.0) is not compatible with the original PluginLoader. You must use the "Decky Loader" which is the react based plugin loader
