### DeckFAQs, a GameFAQs browser for the Steam Deck (v1.1.1)

-   *BUGFIX*: state issue between fullscreen and sidepanel fixed
-   Renders guide directly in side panel instead of through iframes
-   Scrolling to anchor points in HTML guides added
-   Adds Table of Contents for HTML based guides
-   Better fullscreen guide support
-   Possibly some other stuff I forgot because I spent too long working on this
-   _NOTE:_ This version (and any version >= 1.0.0) is not compatible with the original PluginLoader. You must use the "Decky Loader" which is the react based plugin loader
